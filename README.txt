The folder contains:
1. "model.py" which is the model training python script.
2. "evaluate_model.py" which is the main evalution python script.
3. "fashion_model.h5", the trained model
4. "fashion-mnist_test.csv", test datatset
To accomplish the task, I developed two distinct Python scripts. The initial script, "model.py," encompasses the training procedure and the structural design of the classification model. In this instance, I opted for a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The "Fashion MNIST" dataset comprises numerous grayscale images of clothing for both training and testing, all of which are stored in a CSV file. Consequently, I needed to transform these images into a format of 28x28x1.
Executing this script is optional, but if you wish to do so, you can run the code by supplying the training and testing CSV data for "Fashion MNIST." Here's the step-by-step process to run the script:

1. Begin by installing all the required packages and modules listed in the "requirements.txt" file.
2. Launch the script and input the paths to the training and testing datasets via the command line.
3. The script will then run automatically. In this script, we undertake the following actions:
	Load the dataset.
	Convert the pixel values, which are separated by commas, into numpy arrays with a shape of 28x28x1.
	Scale the data by dividing it by 255.
	Proceed to train the CNN model.

The primary script for this task is the second one, named "evaluate_model.py." This script is designed to assess the performance of the trained model using the test dataset and to make predictions based on data from a designated folder.

To execute this script, please adhere to the following instructions:
1. Set up a Python environment and utilize a Python-compatible Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for opening the script. It's recommended to use IDEs like "Spyder" or "VScode."

2. Ensure that you install all the required packages and modules as specified in the "requirements.txt" file.

3. Run the script.

4. The script will prompt you to provide the file path to the test CSV data. Kindly supply the path to the "fashion-mnist_test.csv" file that is included in the folder.

5. Subsequently, the script will display the accuracy results in the command line, based on the test data.
6. Next, it will ask for the path to a folder containing images. Please provide the path to the designated folder.
7. The script will then sequentially output the predicted values for the images within the folder.
8. In case you encounter any messages in the command line, such as ".h5 file not found," please proceed to replace the file path within the code where "fashion_model.h5" is referenced.
9. The script is designed to handle other errors gracefully, including file not found errors.
10. It can take some time to run. please keep patience for those time.

Considering that the dataset consists of low-resolution grayscale images, I determined that employing a straightforward CNN model would be more advantageous than opting for more intricate transfer learning models. This choice led to the attainment of improved accuracy. 

Collaborating with an expert well-versed in image and fashion analysis could enhance our model's performance. With their expertise, they can preprocess the images by emphasizing key features and adjusting the resolution to the necessary specifications before feeding them into the prediction model. This collaboration has the potential to significantly boost accuracy.
(Note: I found it unclear to determine the specific type of data that will be present in the folder. Therefore, I created the script with the assumption that the folder would contain image files.)
